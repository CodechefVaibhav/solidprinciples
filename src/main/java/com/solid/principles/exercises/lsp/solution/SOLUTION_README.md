### Issues with Defective Code

1. **Unexpected Behavior**: A client using `BankAccount` expects to be able to withdraw funds. However, the `FixedDepositAccount` breaks this assumption.
   
2. **Violation of LSP**: The substitution of `BankAccount` with `FixedDepositAccount` leads to broken functionality, violating LSP.

3. **Design Flaw**: The `FixedDepositAccount` should not inherit methods that it cannot support, such as `withdraw()`.

## Solution

To resolve the issue and adhere to the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**, we refactored the design as follows:

1. **Abstract Class**: 
   - We created an abstract base class `BankAccountSolution` to represent common behavior for all account types, such as holding a balance and providing a method to `deposit` funds.
   
2. **Interface Segregation**:
   - Instead of making all accounts support withdrawals, we created a separate interface `WithdrawableAccount` for accounts that can perform withdrawals. This segregates the behavior of accounts that support withdrawal from those that do not.

3. **Specialization**:
   - The `SavingsAccountSolution` implements both the `BankAccountSolution` base class and the `WithdrawableAccount` interface, allowing withdrawals.
   - The `FixedDepositSolutionAccount` inherits from `BankAccountSolution` but does **not** implement `WithdrawableAccount`, as it does not support withdrawals.

This ensures that all account types behave as expected and conform to the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**.
