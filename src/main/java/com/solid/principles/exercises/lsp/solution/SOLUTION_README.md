# Solution

Instead of inheriting from `BankAccount`, create a more general abstraction that supports different account types without forcing inappropriate behavior. This respects the LSP by ensuring that all subclasses adhere to the expected behavior.

# Improvements

- **Adherence to LSP**: `FixedDepositSolutionAccount` no longer alters inherited behavior; instead, it is appropriately separated.
- **Predictable Behavior**: All account types follow their respective rules, avoiding unexpected behavior.
- **Clear Design**: The applicationâ€™s design now clearly represents the differences between account types.
