# Solution

Introduce a strategy pattern where each shipping method is implemented as a separate class. The `ShippingSolutionService` will now work with an abstraction, allowing new shipping methods to be added without modifying the existing service.

# Improvements

- **Open for Extension**: New shipping methods can be added without changing the `ShippingSolutionService`.
- **Closed for Modification**: The existing logic remains unchanged, reducing the risk of errors.
- **Scalability**: The system can easily scale to accommodate new shipping strategies.
